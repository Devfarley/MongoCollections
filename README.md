Stretch your Thoughts:

How would this loosely defined, nonRelational database benefit you? Harm you?
It allows you to put whatever information you like into the database. The reason this could harm you is if incorrect data makes its way into the database when you try to use that data it may not work with the way you have things set up. 

What would be a practical application for storing data like this?
You can store catalogs or users. You can store really anything you like as long as you are consistant with the data you are entering.

What challenges do you see if you store your data in MongoDB?
There are not clear rules to how you store your data and it would be good to set some guildlines to follow for a project to ensure you store your data correctly.
